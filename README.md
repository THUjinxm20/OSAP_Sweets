# OSAP_Sweets
Oxford Study Abroad Program: Sweets flavors analysis

<h2> First task </h2>
<p>
  Analyse the data in the ‘Sweetie Flavour.csv’ data-file and complete the following:
1. Produce some descriptive information about the data – in both graphical and quantitative forms
2. Remove any data that is less useful whilst retaining useful information
3. Create a series of models of the data that enable you to predict the ‘Flavour_score’ given a set of input
features:
a. Your models should be presented in order of increasing complexity
b. Each model should be supported by a description that explains how it is different from the other
models
c. Provide an assessment of the quality of each of the models
d. Where possible, adjust the model to improve its performance.
e. Where you adjust a model, describe how your adjustments either improve or reduce the quality
of the model
4. Your Jupyter notebook should include ‘markdown’ cells that describe the analysis at each step.

  <p>
  Analyse the data in the ‘Customer Preference.csv’ data-file and complete the following:
